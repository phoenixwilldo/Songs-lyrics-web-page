    <pre>VERSE 1
Lately there’s been something in the air
There’s been a lot of smaller talk
When we were younger we would share our fears
Now we’re afraid of being mocked
I still can hear you through all of the silence
Do you need any help calling like I did?

CHORUS
There’s been some changes in our life, oh
I can feel the distance
Space and time, has made everything different
Day and night, oh
Everything has changed and
I don’t know why

VERSE 2
I used to hear your voice inside my head
Now I forget what it sounds like
And all the things we used to leave unsaid
I wish they were said in hindsight
I still can hear you through all of the silence (all the silence)
Do you need any help calling like I did? (oh like I did)

CHORUS
There’s been some changes in our life, oh
I can feel the distance
Space and time, has made everything different (different)
Day and night, oh
Everything is changing
I don’t know why

BRIDGE
Maybe that’s (mm) just the way it is
No matter how matter how much you’re missing it
Sometimes the wind blows in different new directions and lessons are happenin’
Maybe that’s (mm) just the way it is
No matter how matter how much you’re missing it
No love lost, I know it’s innocent
It’s what you make of it

CHORUS
There’s been some changes (changes) in our life, oh
I can feel the distance (distance)
Space and time (time), has made everything different (different)
Day and night, oh
Everything is changing (changing)
I don’t know why (why)
There’s been some changes (changes) in our life, oh
I can feel the distance (distance)
Space and time (time), has made everything different (different)
Day and night, oh
Everything is changing (changing)
I don’t know why</pre>
